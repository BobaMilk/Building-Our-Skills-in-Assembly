# Program File: mips2.asm
# Author: Mila Kuang
# Purpose: Implement a program which multiplies a user input by 10 using only bit shift operations and
# addition. Check to see if your program is correct by using the mult and mflo operators.
# Your program should include a proper and useful prompt for input, and print the results in a
# meaningful manner.
